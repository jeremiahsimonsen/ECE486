 * @file
 * @brief Subroutines to implement a (real) mixer.
 *               Multiple subroutine calls are used to create a signal
 *                   y(n) = x(n)c(n)
 *               where x(n) is the nth input sample, and the values of c(n) 
 *               obtained from a (circularly accessed) array of fixed values.
 *               (Typically, the array c(n) is initialize to give samples of a 
 *               cosine or sine function.)
 *
 *Implementation:
 * Mixers are implemented using three functions:
 *   init_mixer() is called once, and is used to initialize the array
 *                of mixer samples c(n), allocate any required memory,
 *                and perform any other required initialization.
 *   calc_mixer() is called multiple times -- once for every block of input
 *   samples.
 *                It returns the mixer output samples y(n).
 *   destroy_mixer() is called once at the end of the program, and is used
 *               to de-allocate any memory.
 *
 *Function Prototypes and parameters:
 *
 *      #include "mixer.h"
 *      MIXER_T *init_mixer(float *mixer_coefs, int n_coef, int blocksize);
 *
 *         Inputs:
 *              mixer_coefs     pointer to the array of values for c(n)
 *                              The mixer_coefs array is NOT modified by
 *                              init_mixer(), calc_mixer(), or destroy_mixer().
 *              n_coef          Number of samples in the mixer_coefs array
 *              blocksize	Block size for input sample blocks.
 *         Returned:
 *              The function returns a pointer to a "MIXER_T" data type
 *              (which is defined in "mixer.h")
 *              
 *      void calc_mixer(MIXER_T *s, float *x, float *y );
 *
 *         Inputs:
 *              s       pointer to MIXER_T, as provided by init_mixer()
 *              x       Array of input sample values
 *              	
 *         Returned:
 *              On return, y[i] is replaced by the value of x[i]*c[n], where
 *              c(n) is obtained sequentially from the mixer_coefs array of 
 *              values.  Each output sample uses the next value from the 
 *              mixer_coefs array until the end of the array is reached.  The
 *              index into the mixer_coefs array is then reset to the beginning
 *              of the array.
 *              
 *         Note: the array y must be allocated by the caller.
 *              
 *      void destroy_mixer(MIXER_T *s);   
 *         Inputs:
 *              s       pointer to MIXER_T, as provided by init_mixer()
 *         No value is returned.
