 * @brief ECE 486 Spring 2015 Lab 4 Real-time implementation of an FSK detector
 * 
 * @author ECE486 Lab Group 2
 * @author Jacob Allenwood, Travis Russell, Jeremiah Simonsen
 * 
 * @date Mar 22, 2015
 * 
 * This file contains the real-time implementation of an FSK detector for a 
 * Bell 202 half-duplex modem. A 1200 Hz tone denotes a binary 1 and a 2200 Hz
 * tone denotes a binary 0. Binary data is transmitted at 1200 bits/second. The
 * detector in this lab would be combined with a UART to form the core of the 
 * Bell 202 Modem.
 *
 * An input on pin AIN1 is sampled at 48 ksps. The signal is lowpass filtered
 * to extract the data signal, which is bandwidth limited to 3.4 kHz. Audio 
 * tones above 3.4 kHz are rejected. The signal is passed through a second
 * to reject any impulses at DC caused by the signal not be centered at 1.5 V.
 * The sample sequence is decimated, effectively reducing the sample rate by a
 * factor of 5, to 9.6 ksps. The signal is mixed with a complex exponential 
 * (frequency of 1700 Hz - halfway between "0" and "1"), shifting the spectrum
 * down by 1.7/9.6 cycles/sample. The signal is lowpass filtered again to
 * reject duplicate bands. The frequency of the signal is then estimated and
 * a voltage proportional to the distance from the center frequency is output
 * to pin AOUT1
