 * @date Mar 22, 2015
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the filter coefficients that will
 * defined in filter1_coef.c The coefficients will be the output of the 
 * zp2biquad() MATLAB function. This implementation allows for the implementation
 * of a new filter by calling the zp2biquad() function with the new poles
 * and zeros and then re-compiling.
 *
 * This header file must be included by any program that uses the filter
 * coefficients output by the zp2biquad() function.
