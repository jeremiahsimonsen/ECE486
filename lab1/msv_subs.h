 * @author ECE486 Lab Group 2
 * @author Jacob Allenwood, Travis Russell, Jeremiah Simonsen
 * 
 * @date Jan 24, 2015
 * 
 * This file contains subroutine and data-type declarations necessary for 
 * running mean-square-value calculations.
 * 
 * The MSV_STRUCT_T data-type is a struct containing the necessary fields for
 * calculating the running mean-square-value.
 *
 * The init_msv() function initializes an MSV_STRUCT_T variable, allocating
 * memory for all fields. The function takes an integer 'M' indicating the
 * number of samples to average over and an integer 'blocksize' indicating the
 * number of samples in each block of data to be processed. The function returns
 * a pointer to an MSV_STRUCT_T.
 *
 * The calc_msv() function performs the running mean-square-value calculation on
 * a block of samples. It takes a pointer to a float 'x' - the block of samples-
 * and a pointer to an MSV_STRUCT_T 's' - the struct containing the fields 
 * necessary for the calculations. The function returns a pointer to an float,
 * the array of running mean-square-values.
