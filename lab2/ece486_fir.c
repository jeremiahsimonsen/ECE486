 * 
 * Now describe the details of what's going on with the functions in this
 * file.  This can be several paragraphs long and gives the general
 * overview of what's going on.  Virtually every file (.h or .c or 
 * other source code) should include a comment block to describe 
 * its purpose or give an overview of the use of the code. 
 * 
 * Paragraphs are indicated by a blank line in the comment block
 * (except for the optional "*" character at the start of the line).
 * 
 * @verbatim
 *   If doxygen formatting starts to drive you nuts, you can use the 
 *   verbatim construct to avoid all the re-structuring.
 *       1) Who knows if it will help?
 *       2) Note that here are better ways to format lists within doxygen
 * @endverbatim
